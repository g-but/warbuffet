# Code Quality Rules

## Core Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated logic into reusable functions
- Check for existing utilities before creating new ones
- Use constants for repeated values

### SSOT (Single Source of Truth)
- Data should be defined in one place only
- Configuration lives in dedicated files
- Types are defined once and imported

### Minimal Changes
- Only modify what's necessary for the task
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Don't add features not requested

## Before Making Changes

1. Search for existing similar functionality
2. Check if a utility already exists
3. Verify you're not duplicating code

## Code Patterns

- Use existing patterns found in the codebase
- Follow the file's existing style
- Don't introduce new patterns without reason

## What NOT to Do

- Don't add comments explaining obvious code
- Don't create abstractions for one-time use
- Don't add "nice to have" features
- Don't refactor working code unnecessarily
