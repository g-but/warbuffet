# Code Quality Rules

## Project Status

This is a **placeholder repository**. When development begins, update these rules with project-specific guidelines.

## Core Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated logic into reusable functions
- Check for existing utilities before creating new ones
- Use constants for repeated values

### SSOT (Single Source of Truth)
- Data should be defined in one place only
- Configuration lives in dedicated files
- Types are defined once and imported

### Minimal Changes
- Only modify what's necessary for the task
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Don't add features not requested

## Don't

- Add comments explaining obvious code
- Create abstractions for one-time use
- Add "nice to have" features
- Refactor working code unnecessarily
