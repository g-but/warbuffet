# Testing Rules

## Before Committing

1. Run the test suite
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Add tests for new functionality

## Test Quality

- Test behavior, not implementation
- Keep tests focused and readable
- Use descriptive test names

## Commands

```bash
npm test           # Run all tests
npm run test:watch # Watch mode
```
