2. Tech stack details
3. Quick start commands
4. Architecture overview
5. Code locations

## Critical Rules

1. **Search first** - Check for existing code before creating new
2. **Minimal changes** - Only modify what's necessary
3. **Run tests** - Verify changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Follow patterns** - Use existing code style in the codebase

## Don't

- Add features not requested
- Refactor unrelated code
- Create abstractions prematurely
- Ignore existing patterns
